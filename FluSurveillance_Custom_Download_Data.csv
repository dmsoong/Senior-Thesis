The Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) data are preliminary and subject,,,,,,,,,,,
"to change as more data become available. In particular, case counts and rates for recent hospital",,,,,,,,,,,
"admissions are subject to reporting delays. As data are received each week, prior case counts and",,,,,,,,,,,
rates are updated accordingly. FluSurv-NET conducts population-based surveillance for,,,,,,,,,,,
laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations in children <18 years of age and adults.,,,,,,,,,,,
The FluSurv-NET catchment area includes more than 90 selected counties or county equivalents in,,,,,,,,,,,
